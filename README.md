# Ideabox
### Description
This project serves as a repetition-based practice of basic React skills. It is a simple application, a place where you can store your ideas. It is meant to be developed in laps-- getting through to the end of functionality, deleting all your code and starting over again. Hopefully, patterns will emerge and deep learning will take place. 



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
